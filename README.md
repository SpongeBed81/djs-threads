const threads = require("djs-threads")
const threadEvents = threads.events
threads.login("YOUR TOKEN", 98303) //98303 is the intent number "98303" means all of the intents are allowed if you want to calculate your intent number you can use https://discord-intents-calculator.vercel.app/ this site to calculate your own bot's intent number
client.login("YOUR TOKEN")

client.on("ready", () => {
console.log("djs is ready")
})
threadEvents.on("ready", () => {
console.log("djs-threads is ready")
})

client.on("message", (msg) => {
	if(!message.guild) return
	if(msg.author.id == "user_id") {
	new threads.ThreadManager(msg.channel.id).create({
